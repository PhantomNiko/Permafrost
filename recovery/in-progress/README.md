# Current recovery checkpoint

These are working C replacements, ABI hints and firmware changes for the next
milestone. They preserve the recovery work before it replaces the active source
tree. They are not an additional build target or a completed release.

`reference.json` identifies the input image and intended version. The kernel
directories contain decompiler signature corrections, source replacements and
explicit C implementations. The firmware directory contains the current shared
EFI loader work. The repository license applies throughout.

The library directories contain candidate C implementations, initialized data
and export/relocation metadata. All four PNG slices pass the decoding corpus and reader/writer checks for
the reference's four supported formats. ARM32 also cross-decodes both native
and source output. The retained window
slices pass creation, title, size, query-record, numeric and math comparisons
on all four architectures. These checks
do not establish release-wide VM equivalence. The retained C font candidates
pass the raster, numeric and new math ABI corpora on all four architectures;
ARM64 shared-service addresses have been moved to the current kernel base. ARM32's `missing-inputs.txt`
records functions reviewed through the incoming-register recovery pass before
export; obsolete manual units for those functions have been removed.

The audio candidates pass 52 native/source generation, mixing, trim, pitch, speed and
invalid-input comparisons on each architecture. WAV conversion, malformed input,
saving and cross-decoding also match, as do saved context buffers and register
restoration. The ARM32 tests use Darwin's four-byte argument alignment for
64-bit values. Release-wide VM behavior still needs validation.

Diagnostic snapshots and VM disks remain outside tracked source. The normal
build continues to use the last completed source tree until the next milestone
passes its complete source build and VM comparisons. That transition must move
the reviewed implementation into the normal kernel, library, application and SDK
directories and remove this temporary checkpoint. It must not retain another
historical build target.
